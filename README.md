# WebdevCourse

This repository contains my **Web Development learning journey**, structured topic-wise.
Each topic follows a simple rule:

> **First learn the basics → then see a working mini-demo of the same concept.**

The goal is not just theory, but understanding how concepts work in real code.

---

## Repository Structure

Each folder focuses on one core backend/web concept and contains:
- **Basic files** → to understand syntax, core ideas, and logic
- **Mini demos** → small working examples that apply those basics

### 📁 MONGO
- MongoDB fundamentals (CRUD, queries, schema understanding, etc.)
- Mini demos showing how MongoDB works in real use cases
- Includes sample data where required so demos can run easily

### 📁 OOPS
- Object Oriented Programming basics
- Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, etc.
- Mini demos to show how OOPS concepts are used in practical scenarios

### 📁 REST
- REST API fundamentals
- HTTP methods, routes, request/response flow
- Mini demos using Node.js/Express to show working APIs

### 📁 SQL
- SQL basics (queries, joins, constraints, etc.)
- Practice files for understanding database operations
- Mini demos to apply queries on sample tables/data

## Learning Approach

For **every topic**:
1. Start with the **basic files** to understand the concept.
2. Move to the **mini demo** to see how the same concept works in practice.
3. Code is intentionally kept **simple and readable**.
4. Comments are added to explain *why* something is done, not just *what* is done.

---

## Tech Stack Used

- **JavaScript / Node.js** → Mongo & REST
- **SQL** → Database concepts
- Concepts are kept language-consistent inside each folder to avoid confusion.

---

## Purpose of This Repo

- Personal learning and revision
- A structured reference for core web development concepts
- To build a strong foundation before moving to larger projects

---

## How to Use

- Clone the repository
- Go topic by topic
- run the command - 'npm install' - to install all the nesseccary packages required to run the specific miniDemo
- Read basics first, then run the mini demo
- Modify code and experiment — that’s the point

---

## Note

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production project.
Clarity and understanding are prioritized over advanced optimizations.
