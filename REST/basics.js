//Representational State Transfer - is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services

//RESTful APIs - apis's which applies REST concepts-- used to perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete ) operations 
// API must contain the data what it fetches - e.g.- twitter api gets tweets - api ->GET/2/tweets 

//CRUD operations :-
//o GET - retrives resources
//o POST - submits new data to the server
//o PUT - updates existing data
//o PATCH -updates existing data partially
//o DELETE - removes data

//resource - particular data on which the CRUD operations are being performed - e.g.:tweets, post , users
